          a <b>certified AWS Cloud Engineer</b> and <b>former AWS Cloud Club Captain</b>,
          passionate about cloud computing, web development, and fostering tech
          communities. As a <b>Computer Science student</b> at <b>Cavite State University
          - Main Campus</b>, I took the initiative to go beyond the curriculum,
          immersing myself in cloud technologies, earning AWS certifications,
          and interning at AWS, where I gained hands-on experience in designing
          scalable solutions.</br></br>My journey began with a curiosity for programming,
          which grew into a mission to empower others—especially women in
          tech—to explore cloud computing.</br></br>As an <b>AWS Cloud Club Captain</b>, I:
          <ol>
            <li>Mentored aspiring cloud practitioners.</li>
            <li>Organized workshops to educate students on AWS technologies.</li>
            <li>Collaborated with industry leaders to bridge the gap between students and real-world cloud careers.</li>
          </ol>
          Now, as I advance in my career, I continue advocating for inclusive tech spaces and leveraging the cloud to drive innovation.</br></br><i>Let’s connect and build the future of cloud computing together!</i> ☁️🚀
